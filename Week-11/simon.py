# In this code, I follow the oracle construction style provided by the instructor,
# where the oracle is represented as a unitary matrix. While the sample code used
# an identity matrix (i.e., no hidden structure), here I implement a *periodic* oracle
# for Simon's problem, specifically encoding a period of '10' (in binary).

# The main tasks performed are:
# - Constructing the oracle matrix for a function f(x) with hidden period 10,
#   following the same matrix-gate approach as in the instructor's example.
# - Building a 4-qubit quantum circuit using Cirq: Hadamard gates on the first two
#   qubits, applying the oracle gate, Hadamard gates again, and measuring the x register.
# - Running the quantum circuit multiple times and collecting the measurement results.

# Main conclusion:
# - Unlike the identity oracle, which shows no structure in the measurement results,
#   the periodic oracle leads to measurement outcomes that satisfy the equation zÂ·c=0,
#   where c is the hidden period. This confirms that Simon's algorithm can reveal
#   the period from the measurement statistics when the oracle encodes a periodic function.
